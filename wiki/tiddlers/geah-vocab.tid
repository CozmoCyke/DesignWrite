Below is the 50 word vocabulary used in Dr. Seuss' story [[Green Eggs and Ham]]. It is interesting to note that, according to this MentalFloss [[article|http://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19684/quick-10-stories-behind-10-dr-seuss-stories]] (as cited by [[Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham#Vocabulary]], via [[CNN|http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/01/23/mf.seuss.stories.behind/index.html]]), the seriously limited vocabulary for this story came about as the result of a bet between Dr Seuss and his publisher.

> Bennett Cerf, Dr. Seuss' editor, bet him that he couldn't write a book using 50 words or less. "The Cat in the Hat" was pretty simple, after all, and it used 225 words. Not one to back down from a challenge, Mr. Geisel started writing and came up with "Green Eggs and Ham" -- which uses exactly 50 words. The 50 words, by the way, are: [[a]], [[am]], [[and]], [[anywhere]], [[are]], [[be]], [[boat]], [[box]], [[car]], [[could]], [[dark]], [[do]], [[eat]], [[eggs]], [[fox]], [[goat]], [[good]], [[green]], [[ham]], [[here]], [[house]], [[I]], [[if]], [[in]], [[let]], [[like]], [[may]], [[me]], [[mouse]], [[not]], [[on]], [[or]], [[rain]], [[Sam]], [[say]], [[see]], [[so]], [[thank]], [[that]], [[the]], [[them]], [[there]], [[they]], [[train]], [[tree]], [[try]], [[will]], [[with]], [[would]], [[you]].
