I've had a read through of this article, both the [[full-text|http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/]] and the [[summary on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think]]. What amazing foresight this guy had! I had never heard of him before, nor his contribution to the computer industry, prior to taking this course.

I've started a discussion about this article on the [[Google discussion forums|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/designwrite/VcZ7FH17nxs]]. I mentioned there something relevant that I read a few years ago, by [[Clay Shirky|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky]], entitled [[Ontology is Overrated: Categories, Links, and Tags|http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html]], which seems to reflect the thoughts of Bush on "the matter of selection" he mentioned in section six of this article.
