I remember a book I used to own as a child (many years ago now) which was published in the same format as this one: one book started at one end, flip it over, and the other book started from the other end. I don't recall if it was the same book as this, but it was quite a novel idea at the time.

Anyway, I've had a brief read-through of the [[available excerpts|http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf]], the [[Wikipedia entry|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines]], and the [[commentary|http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/computer-lib/]] linked to from the courseware. I even did a [[search in our local public library|http://www.elgar.govt.nz/search/?searchtype=t&SORT=D&searcharg=Computer+Lib&searchscope=1&x=51&y=13]] to see if it was available. It's a bit hard to search for a single book with two different titles! It didn't look like it was there though.

From what I read of the excerpts, this book seems very promising. If it can live up to the hype of ''//"helping people to understand computers"//'', then I must get hold of a copy of it for my wife.

I've recently been taking her along to beginner computing courses, where they have been teaching her Microsoft Office 2013 by rote. My disdain for such a method of learning about computers is falling on deaf ears though. Both my wife and her tutor seem to think that learning about computers by rote, and then having to learn again when a new version of MS Office comes out, is quite normal and natural. Grr! 

I wish my wife could understand computers the way I do, but she didn't grow up around them as I did. I guess she wishes that I could understand people the way she does, but as an [[aspie|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome]], I'm at as much of a disadvantage there as she is with computers.
