<abbr title="A traditional Māori welcome, from New Zealand.">//[[Kia ora tātou|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_ora]].//</abbr>

Greetings to my fellow classmates from [[SUNY Poly|https://www.sunypoly.edu/]] in New York, USA. As an extramural student myself, and a [[SOOC]] learner, I am happy to welcome you to my {{DesignWrite}} TiddlyWiki instance. Thank you for taking the time to visit me here.

On this tiddler, I am keeping a collection of links to your {{DesignWrite}} TiddlyWiki instances, so that I can easily visit you (virtually) and see what you're up to on the course. I have gathered these links from the [[DesignWrite Google Drive|https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tk91wqty552z6z1/designwrite.html#DesignWrite%20GoogleDrive]], where you've been sharing them as part of the course exercises. This helps me feel more a part of the class, as I cannot get to campus from here, naturally.

This list is in no particular order. If I have left you out, please don't feel offended. I just might not have seen your post in the Google Drive yet.
