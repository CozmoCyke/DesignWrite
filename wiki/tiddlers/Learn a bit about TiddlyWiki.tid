Over the last few months, since mid-September last year, I've started learning about TiddlyWiki. I've read through all of the [[Learning|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Learning]] tiddlers, and started engaging with the TiddlyWiki user community on the [[Google Groups discussion forums|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywiki]].

I've picked up a few handy tips for using TW along the way, but I'm still learning the basics. I haven't delved too deeply into filters, widgets, macros, or plugins yet.
